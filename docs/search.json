    "text": "Final Year Project (FYP) Project Title\nExploring Brand Portfolio Strategies and Financial Performance in the Automotive Industry\nProject Background\nThe automotive industry is highly competitive, with major manufacturers adopting different strategies to expand their market presence. One common approach is brand portfolio expansion, where companies acquire or develop multiple brands to target different customer segments.\nMy Final Year Project focuses on analyzing how these large automotive companies build brand empires and how the number of brands they own relates to their financial performance.\nProject Objectives\nThe key objectives of this project were:\nTo compare the number of brands owned by major automotive manufacturers\nTo analyze the relationship between brand ownership and company earnings\nTo use data visualization to communicate insights clearly and effectively\nData and Visualization\n{width=85%}\nFigure: Number of brands owned by selected car manufacturers and their EBIT (in billion USD).\nThe visualization presents two quantitative variables:\nA horizontal bar chart showing the number of brands or marques owned by each company\nCircular markers indicating Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) over the period Q2 2021 to Q1 2022\nKey Findings\nFrom the visualization and analysis:\nVolkswagen Group owns the highest number of brands, indicating an aggressive brand expansion strategy.\nToyota, despite owning fewer brands, achieves one of the highest EBIT values, suggesting strong operational efficiency.\nCompanies such as Tesla demonstrate that high profitability can be achieved even with a limited number of brands.\nThese findings suggest that while brand expansion increases market coverage, it does not guarantee higher profitability.\nRationale for Visualization Choice\nThis visualization was chosen because:\nIt allows direct comparison between companies\nIt effectively combines categorical data (companies) and numerical data (brand count and earnings)\nThe layout makes it easy to identify patterns and outliers\nBy presenting multiple variables in a single view, the visualization supports data-driven storytelling.\nSkills and Learning Outcomes\nThrough this Final Year Project, I developed and strengthened skills in:\nData analysis and interpretation\nData visualization principles\nCritical thinking and business insight generation\nCommunicating complex information clearly using visuals\nThis project helped me understand how data visualization can be used not only for presentation, but also as a tool for analytical reasoning."

    "text": "Reflection on the Use of GenAI GenAI Tools Used\nIn this assessment, I used ChatGPT as the primary GenAI tool to assist me in completing the tasks. I chose this tool because it is capable of providing clear explanations, structured guidance, and examples related to Quarto, GitHub Pages, markdown formatting, and data visualization concepts, which are essential for this assignment.\nHow GenAI Helped Me Complete the Assessment\nGenAI supported me throughout different stages of the assessment:\nTechnical setup: It helped me understand the correct steps to create a GitHub Pages repository, clone it into RStudio, and configure the Quarto project properly. For example, it clarified why the repository name must exactly match my GitHub username and how to fix directory-related errors.\nContent structuring: GenAI assisted in drafting structured content for different website pages, such as the Data Visualization page and the Final Year Project page. This helped me organize my ideas more clearly rather than starting from a blank page.\nMarkdown and formatting: It provided examples of markdown syntax for headings, images, lists, and captions, which improved the presentation and readability of my website.\nReflection guidance: GenAI helped me understand what aspects to reflect on, ensuring that my reflection was relevant to the assessment requirements.\nBenefits of Using GenAI\nThe main benefits of using GenAI include:\nEfficiency: It significantly reduced the time needed to troubleshoot technical issues and draft content.\nClarity: Explanations were easy to understand, especially for complex concepts such as YAML configuration and GitHub Pages deployment.\nLearning support: Instead of giving final answers only, GenAI helped me understand why certain steps were required, which improved my learning experience.\nChallenges and Limitations\nDespite its usefulness, there were also challenges:\nGenAI responses still require critical thinking. Some suggestions needed to be adjusted to fit the exact assessment rules.\nOver-reliance on GenAI could reduce independent problem-solving if not used carefully.\nThe tool does not fully understand my personal context unless I clearly explain it, so human judgment is still necessary.\nFuture Use of GenAI in Study and Work\nIn the future, I believe GenAI tools will be highly beneficial for:\nSupporting coding and debugging tasks\nDrafting reports and documentation\nBrainstorming ideas and improving clarity in technical communication\nHowever, I will continue to use GenAI as a supporting tool rather than a replacement for my own thinking and learning.\nFinal Thoughts\nOverall, the use of GenAI enhanced my productivity and confidence in completing this assessment. When used responsibly, GenAI can be a powerful learning aid that complements human effort and supports applied learning, which aligns well with the learning objectives of this course."

    "text": "Analysis of Brand Ownership and Financial Performance in Major Automotive Companies\nProject Overview\nThis is my analysis on how large automotive companies build brand empires through the ownership of multiple marques, and how this strategy relates to their financial performance. The project uses quantitative data to explore whether owning more brands necessarily leads to higher earnings.\nData Visualization Used in the Project\n{width=85%}\nFigure: Number of brands owned by major car manufacturers and their earnings (EBIT).\nThe visualization above compares:\nNumber of brands/marques owned by each car manufacturer (bar chart)\nEarnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in billion U.S. dollars (circular markers)\nWhat the Visualization Shows\nFrom the visualization, we can observe that:\nVolkswagen Group owns the highest number of brands (16), forming the largest brand portfolio among the companies shown.\nToyota, despite owning fewer brands (5), records one of the highest EBIT values, indicating strong profitability.\nSome companies with fewer brands, such as Tesla, still achieve significant earnings, suggesting that brand quantity alone does not determine financial success.\nThis highlights the difference between brand expansion strategies and operational efficiency.\nWhy This Visualization Was Chosen\nThis visualization was chosen because:\nIt effectively compares two quantitative variables: number of brands and earnings\nThe horizontal bar chart allows easy comparison of brand ownership\nThe circular markers provide a clear visual cue for financial performance\nBy combining these elements, the visualization tells a clear business story in a single view.\nInsights and Learning Outcomes\nThrough this project, I learned that:\nData visualization can reveal insights that are not immediately obvious from raw numbers\nOwning more brands does not always translate into higher profitability\nStrategic focus and operational efficiency play a critical role in business success\nThis project strengthened my understanding of data-driven analysis, visual storytelling, and how visualization can support strategic decision-making in real-world business contexts.\nConclusion\nThis Final Year Project demonstrates how quantitative data and visualization techniques can be used to analyze industry trends and business strategies. The insights gained from this project emphasize the importance of thoughtful interpretation of data rather than relying solely on surface-level metrics."
